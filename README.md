# omnirom_N_a5_releases
Omnirom 7.1 releases for galaxy a5 SM-A500FU.

Releases are uploaded monthly according to my jenkins builds, if they don't get any build errors

Since google usually releases security updates before the 10th day of every month, builds are scheduled for the 10th day of every month

Releases can be found at https://github.com/DeadSquirrel01/omnirom_N_a5_releases/releases

This project is discontinued because omni-7.1 is not officially supported anymore.

My jenkins will be dedicated to lineage 15, instead. Builds will be located at https://github.com/DeadSquirrel01/lineage-15_a5_releases
